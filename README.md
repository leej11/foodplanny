A way to automate weekly meal planning with your todo list and calendar

## Plan

1. Ask the user what meal you want to add to the plan
2. You get to choose what day you want the meal
3. It looks up the meal from SQLite DB for the ingredients required
4. It adds the meal to Google Calendar
5. It asks if you want to add another meal to the plan?


## Future ideas
- Viewing the current list of planned meals (future days)
-
